## Home Automation Services

### Voice/Personal Assistants

Previously, government and mob had to break into your house to install bugs.
Now you can pay a small amount of money and install yourself bugs which allow
3rd parties to eavesdrop on you.

* Apple Siri
* Amazon Alexa
* Google Assistant

OpenSource services promising no eavesdropping (please keep in mind that for
some of these projects, "OpenSource" is just a marketing bait):

* [Mycroft.AI](https://mycroft.ai/), code: https://github.com/MycroftAI
* [Snips](https://www.snips.ai/), code: https://github.com/snipsco/
  * Some links point to https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform , which isn't available.

  * Posts: [1](https://medium.com/snips-ai/snips-air-a-private-by-design-open-source-decentralized-voice-assistant-a31e27fb799b)
* [Jasper](https://jasperproject.github.io/), code: https://github.com/jasperproject
* [Open Assistant](https://openassistant.org/), code: https://github.com/openassistant
* [Leon-AI](https://getleon.ai/), code: https://github.com/leon-ai/leon
* [Olivia-AI](https://olivia-ai.org/), code: https://github.com/olivia-ai/olivia

### Video Surveillance

Many services tout "P2P" in video surveillance, to allow your smartphone to
connect to your camera - when you're in your home or on another side of the
world. That's oxymoron of course, there's nothing "point-to-point" in how
it's implemented. Both your camera and smarphone connect to faraway 3rd-party
cloud server (this happens even if both in the same home network, 5 meters
one from another). All video goes via (and thus to) 3rd party of course.

[Mirai Botnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)) was/is a botnet
mostly consisting of video cameras controlled by 3rd party.


## Related/useful Services and Software

### Dashboards

One of the basic tasks of Home Automation is visualization and control.
Dashboards is a basic way to do that. Dashboard is usually included into
"full stack" HA systems, but what if you don't like it or need a custom
one? Note that majority of systems below offer visualization only (no
control).

* https://github.com/Shopify/dashing - Ruby, 11128 stars, no longer maintained
  * https://github.com/Smashing/smashing - maintained fork, 1665 stars
* https://github.com/evolvedlight/pydashie - "Port of Dashing to Python" 416 stars
* https://github.com/allegro/tipboard - Python, 773 stars
* https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard - JavaScript, 5416 stars
* Grid Layouts
  * https://github.com/ducksboard/gridster.js - The "default" solution, jQuery plugin (6188 stars)
  * https://github.com/haltu/muuri - No jQuery dep, no item resize (7832 stars)
  * https://github.com/hootsuite/grid (3433 stars)

### Floor Plans

A step above and beyond dashboards is visualizing what happens where on the
actual floorplan of your home.

* [ha-floorplan](https://github.com/pkozul/ha-floorplan) - Floorplans for Home Assistant
* [Sweet Home 3D](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sweethome3d/) - Open Source
  desktop application (Java)
* https://planner5d.com - Online editor, allows to save/import plan in JSON
  format. Image renders are freemium.
