## Dashboards

One of the basic tasks of Home Automation is visualization and control.
Dashboards is a basic way to do that. Dashboard is usually included into
"full stack" HA systems, but what if you don't like it or need a custom
one? Note that majority of systems below offer visualization only (no
control).

## Floor Plans

A step above and beyond dashboards is vusualizing what happens where on the
actual floorplan of your home.
